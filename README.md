## Influence of Neighbours on One’s Own opinion <br> – Election prediction using social network topology
Election results prediction using the social network neighbourhood information is a complex network theory problem which includes advanced complex network modelling and complex network analysis techniques. Presuming that social networks display a high degree of homophily, which in binary elections leads to polarization and a split into two giant clusters, we translated this problem into a domain of cluster size inference, for these two clusters.

First, we have analysed how the social neighbourhood is related to a person's voting preference. Next, we have shown that the prediction of this preference can be done from the neighbourhood information in a straightforward manner. Finally, we have shown how, by modelling social networks with the expanded stochastic Kronecker graph model and using our novel _Them vs. us estimator_, network's vote share can successfully be estimated, even from a small and highly biased node sample.
